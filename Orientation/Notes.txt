Data Science Simplified:
What is Data Science?? --> its the study of generalizable extraction of knowledge from data.

Need to Remember Euclid's Algorithm for Greatest Common Integer. 

What is ML today -->  Machine Learning: utilizes algorithms so machines can learn from data automatically.

Predictive Methods --> Use some variables to predict unknown or future values of other variables (kind of Supervised)
Descriptive Methods --> Find human-interpretable patterns that describe the data. 
Supervised learning: Study labeled data (data with response)
Unsupervised learning: Study unlabeled data (without response)
